## FAQ

**Can podcast hosting platforms handle both audio-only and video podcasts?**

Yes, several platforms support video podcasting alongside traditional audio. Castos offers both audio and video podcast hosting with automatic YouTube uploads. Spotify for Podcasters now supports video podcasts, short-form clips, and custom thumbnails. Platforms like Riverside specialize in high-quality video recording with 4K capture, while most traditional hosts focus primarily on audio with video as a secondary feature.

**How do unlimited hosting plans actually work when platforms charge monthly fees?**

Unlimited hosting means you can upload as many episodes as you want without storage caps, but platforms may limit other factors. Castos and Podbean offer unlimited storage for a flat monthly rate with no episode or bandwidth limits. Transistor provides unlimited podcasts and storage but caps monthly downloads, requiring upgrades as your audience grows. Some platforms charge based on downloads rather than storage, like Simplecast, which offers unlimited uploads but prices by listener volume.

**What's the difference between dynamic ad insertion and pre-recorded ads in episodes?**

Dynamic ad insertion places ads into episodes automatically after publishing, allowing you to update or swap ads without re-uploading files. This lets you monetize old episodes with current sponsors and target ads based on listener location or behavior. Pre-recorded ads are baked into your audio file permanently, meaning every listener hears the same ad forever regardless of when they download the episode. Dynamic insertion gives more flexibility and higher revenue potential, especially for back catalog monetization.
